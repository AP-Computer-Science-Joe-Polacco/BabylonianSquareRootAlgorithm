/**
 * The Babylonian algorithm to compute the square root of a positive number n is as follows:
 * 1. Make a guess at the answer (you can pick n/2 as your initial guess).
 * 2. Compute r = n / guess
 * 3. Set guess = (guess +r)/ 2
 * 4. Go back to step 2 for as many iterations as necessary. The more you repeat steps
 * 2 and 3, the closer guess will become to the square root of n.
 * Write a program that inputs a double for n, iterates through the Babylonian algorithm
 * five times, and outputs the answer as a double. Your
 * answer will be most accurate for small values of n.
