     * This method computes the square root of a positive number using the Babylonian algorithm.
     * 
     * The Babylonian algorithm to compute the square root of a positive number n is as follows:
     * 1. Make a guess at the answer (pick n/2 as your initial guess).
     * 2. Compute r = n / guess
     * 3. Set guess = (guess +r)/ 2
     * 4. Go back to step 2 for five iterations
     *

     * @param n a positive number 
     * @return an approximation of the square root of n using the Babylonian algorithm
